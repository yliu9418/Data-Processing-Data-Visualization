Analysis of Student's Academic Performance using Machine Learning and Data Visualization

In this project, we evaluated these questions on data mining for education:  
What are significant and insignificant factors toward academic performance based on generated models?   
How do the different attributes affect students' academic performance?
How can we visualize our findings to parents, educators, and students so that it's easy to understand what are positive reinforcements?
